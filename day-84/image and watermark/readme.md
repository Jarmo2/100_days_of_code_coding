### Image Watermarking Desktop App

I followed this Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

This course finalises with 20 challenges covering all aspects which were introduced during this course.

This project covers the challenge from day 84 (fourth challenge). One of those challenges was building my own website:
https://jarmo2.github.io/ 
On this website you can find all the projects I have built inspired by _100 days of code_.
The instructions given for this project were as follows:
_A Desktop program where you can upload images and add a watermark._

### Installation

For this simple program you need Python and the following libraries:
- Tkinter
- Pillow

### Usage

This is a simple desktop app which allows you to put a watermark on a picture you upload to the program.
The watermark is placed in the top left corner of the picture.
In this beta version the text is predefined, but an update is about to come.

This program is helpful from a programmer's point of view as this program involves:
- object oriented programming
- use of different modules within a Python program.
- direct interaction with the operating system - upload of pictures.
