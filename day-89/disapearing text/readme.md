### Disappearing Text Writing App

I followed this Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

This course finalises with 20 challenges covering all aspects which were introduced during this course.

This project covers the challenge from day 89 (9th challenge). One of those challenges was building my own website:
https://jarmo2.github.io/ 
On this website you can find all the projects I have built inspired by _100 days of code_.
The instructions given for this project were as follows:
_A writing app where if you stop typing, your work will disappear._

For this program I used the tkinter.

I learnt how to save information from tkinter to a txt file and how to make tkinter listen and react if any key is pressed.
