### Image Watermarking Desktop App

I followed this Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

This course finalises with 20 challenges covering all aspects which were introduced during this course.

This project covers the challenge from day 84 (fifth challenge). One of those challenges was building my own website:
https://jarmo2.github.io/ 
On this website you can find all the projects I have built inspired by _100 days of code_.
The instructions given for this project were as follows:
_A Tkinter GUI desktop application that tests your typing speed._
