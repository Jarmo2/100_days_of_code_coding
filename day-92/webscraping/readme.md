### Custom Web Scraper

I followed this Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

This course finalises with 20 challenges covering all aspects which were introduced during this course.

This project covers the challenge from day 92 (12th challenge). One of those challenges was building my own website:
https://jarmo2.github.io/ 
On this website you can find all the projects I have built inspired by _100 days of code_.
The instructions given for this project were as follows:
_Build a custom web scraper to collect data on things that you are interested in._

For this program I used beautifulsoup (bs4) to scrap the website vesellfinder.com to find the current location of the ship
Bader III which is a live stock carrier. I added some news about this ship and the live stock carrier issue in general.

Then, I embedded a java script widget from another vessel tracking site to show the current location of Bader III on a map.
With the information I got from vesselfinder.com I feed two other widgets showing the current weather of the current location of Bader III 
and information about historic events which happened on the same date as the expected arrival.
