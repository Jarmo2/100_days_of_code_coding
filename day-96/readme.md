### An Online Shop

I followed this Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

This course finalises with 20 challenges covering all aspects which were introduced during this course.

This project covers the challenge from day 96 (16th challenge). One of those challenges was building my own website:
https://jarmo2.github.io/ 
On this website you can find all the projects I have built inspired by _100 days of code_.
The instructions given for this project were as follows:
_An eCommerce website with payment processing._

With this program you can:
- book a silly entertainment - dog surfing
- manage your dog surfing sessions
- get a notification for your upcoming dog surfing sessions
- pay your dog surfing session online
- create a user account

# This program is still a work in progress and will be updated once I have mastered SQL and webhooks.

This program is a mock up only at the moment. I am still learning how to work with webhooks. This protocol is needed to work with the Adyen API.
In addition, I need to work on my SQL skills to allow a booking engine.
Moreover, with the help of SMTPlib a confirmation email shall be sent.
I also have to set up a VENV for my API keys.
